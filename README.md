## Overview
There's never been a better time to have a beer in San Francisco. But are you bothering by long time drives? Or anxious with choice overload? This app we developed is aimed to provide users the route and schedule that minimizes the time on the road and maximizes the time spent enjoying beer. 

Given start time and duration, how can one take the optimal route and drink in as many pubs as one wants?  We transformed this problem to [**Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows**](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/cvrptw).  By leveraging the data of pubs' business hours and locations, we want people who use this app all can have efficient crawls.
